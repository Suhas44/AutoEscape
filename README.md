# EscapeSquared

EscapeSquared is an extension that allows you to escape special characters when working with strings.

## Features

EscapeSquared can be applied on strings that have been already pasted in your code or on text that you have copied. This extension can be used for a variety of cases, such as escaping quotes when working with stringified JSON objects to escaping backslashes when pasting file paths.

<!---
For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
